## Introduction

Just *started* working with using TailwindCSS...by following a Skillshare course.

- https://www.skillshare.com/en/classes/introduction-to-tailwind-css/1784420695/projects

So far I'm finding using TailwindCSS is really easy to set up/understand/and, just generally get going.

The CDN/Content Delivery Network external CSS file I'm using is:

> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tailwindcss/browser@4"></script>
